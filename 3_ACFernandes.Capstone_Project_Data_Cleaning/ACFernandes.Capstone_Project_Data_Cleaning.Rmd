#### Cleaning the Data

******

Introductory note

      The aim of this file is to generate a cleaned dataset. 
      
      This file explains the variables available in the raw data set, the
      cleaning process, the variables that will be needed for analysis and
      the generation of new features/variables (feature engineering) and
      provides a data dictionary of all the variables in the cleaned dataset. 
      
      The end product of the following code generates a new dataset named
      `edclean`. This is data used for exploration of trends in the association
      of ethnic density with death by suicide. 
      
      The Data Dictionary is provided in this file. 

******

#### Description of the raw (`ed`) dataset

******

```{r structure_of_ed_data, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
str(ed)
```


The `str(ed)` output (not shown) shows that this raw dataset `ed` contains data or variables that can be sectioned into categories:

  - the patient demographics,      
  - ethnic density score (which is the main exposure variable),      
  - suicide variable (the main outcome variable), and        
  - other variables (e.g. ethnic density scores and numbers), which may be          confounding variables or redundant.      

In addition,

  - there are 47581 observations (i.e. patients) and 67 variables,   
  - lots of NA values (see screenshot below),    
  - inexplicable column headings,   
  - redundant variables,    
  - potentially duplicate variables and    
  - several continuous and categorical data variables, that may or may not 
    contain the same data or need to be manipulated for more utility,   
  - not all the 67 variables are infomative or useful    

```{r Missing_data_map_unprocessed_data, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.width=15, fig.height=15, cache = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#missmap(ed, main = "Missing values vs observed") 
# [ref] save this image and link it back in using ![]()
```

******

Here's a missing map image displaying all the observations and variables in the raw `ed` dataset. The missing values are color coded (red for values, non-red for missing values).

Details of the data cleaning required on the raw (`ed`) dataset


| Variable Name      | Notes                                          |  
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|  
| JunkID            | can be deleted, redundant |  
| Gender_Cleaned    | There are 2 "empty" Gender cells. Will replace them with NA |  
| DOB_Cleaned       | one NA value in row 45501, not sure what to do with it, will leave until further analysis |  
| Marital_Cleaned   | 3803 blank values, no NA values. 3803 blank values assigned to NA |  
| primary_diagnosis | can be deleted, redundant. lots of different diagnosis in unstructured and structured format. and is potentially redundant because there are other variables that are flag variables for the main diagnoses. Diagnosis and diagnosis date columns contain more than 50% NA values. The NA values imply patients who are not diagnosed with the particular disorder. Will replace NA with 0.   |  
| ethnicitycleaned  | is fine, no NA or blank values |  
| imd_score         | 49 NA values, not sure what to do here. will leave it in until further anlysis. |  
| diagnosis_date to Bipolar_Diag_Date | these variables are dates of the main diagnoses and binary flag variables for diagnoses, NA in these variables means patient does not have the disorder. So perhaps better to change it to 0 instead. |  
| ons_date_of_death      | 5310 deaths in the cohort|  
| Suicide                | 263 suicides in the cohort|  
| ICD10_UnderlyingCause  | redundant variable, delete|  
| LSOAClosestToDiagnosis | LSOA area level address code|  
| LSOA11                 | redundant, delete|  
| lsoa01                 | redundant, delete|  
| LSOA_NAME              | name of boroughs |  
| C and D                | are empty delete|  
| All_Usual_Residents to  AP | variable names are not informative and need to be renamed. These variables are ethnic density (number and percentage of people of different ethnic groups in the corresponding LSOA code) will be needed to generate the main exposure variable "ethnicdensityscore". Some variables with variables names not decipherable and need renaming (e.g. "AL" = OtherBlack_EDPercent). Original names available from original Stata database (not shown). The exposure variable "ethnic density scores" will need to generated using the available columns in the dataset.     |

#### Code to Clean the Data

******

Cleaning the Gender variable 
```{r processing_data_gender, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# tabulating the data to check columns
table(ed$Gender_Cleaned) 

# tabulating the data to check NA values
table(is.na(ed$Gender_Cleaned)) 

# no NA values, 2 blank ("") values. 

#       Female   Male 
#     2  23106  24473 

#recoding blank gender values as NA
ed$Gender_Cleaned[ed$Gender_Cleaned == ""] <- NA
table(ed$Gender_Cleaned) 
table(is.na(ed$Gender_Cleaned))

#identify where gender NA rows are
which(is.na(ed$Gender_Cleaned)) # row 682 and 30844
samples_to_remove <- which(is.na(ed$Gender_Cleaned)) # row 682 and 30844

#removing samples from original data "ed"
# overwriting ed with new ed.
ed <- ed[-samples_to_remove, ]

table(is.na(ed$Gender_Cleaned))
table(ed$Gender_Cleaned)
#       Female   Male 
#        23106  24473

```

******

Cleaning the Marital Status variable 
```{r processing_data_marital, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# tabulating data
table(ed$Marital_Cleaned) # 3803 blank ("") values.
table(is.na(ed$Marital_Cleaned)) # no NA values

# replacing blank values in Marital_Cleaned variable with "Unknown"
ed$Marital_Cleaned[ed$Marital_Cleaned == ""] <- "Unknown"

table(ed$Marital_Cleaned) # New category name is "Unknown" = 3803
```


*******

Cleaning the Diagnoses columns 
```{r processing_data_diagnosis, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
# replacing NAs with 0 in the diagnosis columns
ed$Schizophrenia_Diag[is.na(ed$Schizophrenia_Diag)] <- 0
ed$SchizoAffective_Diag[is.na(ed$SchizoAffective_Diag)] <- 0
ed$Bipolar_Diag[is.na(ed$Bipolar_Diag)] <- 0
ed$Depressive_Diag[is.na(ed$Depressive_Diag)] <- 0

### Feature Engineering 

******

List of new features added:

- The main exposure variable: Ethnic Density Score (named "ethnicdensityscore")  
      
- Ethnicity (named "ethnicity")  
  
- Age variables (named "ageatdiagnosis", "ageatdeath" and "agegroups") - 
Age at Diagnosis", "Age at Death" and "Age Group"  
      
- Borough variable (named "LSOA_4boroughs"): Croydon, Lewisham, Southwark, 
Lambeth and Other
      
- Cause of Death Variable (named "DeathBy")

Below is the code used to generate the listed new features.

#       - The main exposure variable of the dataset is Ethnic Density (ED) score.
#         Ethnic density is defined as the composition of each ethnic group
#         residing in a geographical area of a given size (usually a fairly large
#         geographical area, known as Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) which
#         consists of around 1500 residents).
#       
#       - Since, in the original dataset `ed`, each patient was already assigned 
#         to ethnic density  (for every ethnic group) based on their LSOA code, 
#         to assign OWN ethnicity ethnic density score to each individual, the
#         relevant ethnic density score based on patient ethnicity was selected
#         and assigned to each patient.

# Code generating an ethnic density score for each patient

__Ethnicity variable (named "ethnicity")__ 

      Some of the ethnic groups are too small in numbers, these groups 
      will be aggregated while still maintaining their own-ethnic group ethnic 
      density scores and their respective suicide numbers also 
      decrease (data not shown), which make it difficult to analyse and could 
      potentially bias estimates towards ethnic groups that have larger sizes. 
      
      Grouping ethnic groups into larger ethnic categories (White, Other White,
      Irish, Black, Other Black, Caribbean, Asian and Mixed Race).
