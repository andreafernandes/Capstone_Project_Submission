|.html File Name        | Brief Description |   
|:---------------------|:------------------|
| **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Introduction.html** | This file introduces the concept of the ethnic density effect, how to measure it, introduces some results from the literature, introduces the cohort and dataset and states the current aims of this project. |
| **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Cleaning.html** | The raw data (named `ed`) has been cleaned (and renamed `edclean`). The code can be found here **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Cleaning.Rmd** |
| **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Exploration.html** | The cleaned data has been explored and saved for further analysis. This file explores visually the association between ethnic density and death by suicide, with which we can form a hypothesis to test. It also unveils a potential demonstration of "the ethnic density effect" by comparing ethnic density of the community to ethnic density within the trust. The code can be found here **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Exploration.Rmd**|
| **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Analysis.html** | This file explores the association between death by suicide and ethnic density scores. The data anaysis code can be found here: **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Analysis.Rmd**  |
| **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Analysis_Part2.html** | This file explores the association between trust ethnic density and community ethnic density scores. The data anaysis code can be found here: **ACFernandes.Capstone_Project_Data_Analysis_Part2.Rmd** |
